It’s a skill that lets you switch between concepts easily, and adapt our behaviour if something isn’t working. It lets you think of fresh ideas, make novel connections and collaborate with others. Intrapreneurs need to switch mental gears when moving from one subject to another, abandoning one way of thinking about a problem when it does not lead to a solution, adopting another way of thinking, and giving up erroneous information to accept new and more relevant information. Cognitive flexibility and the metacognitive process in entrepreneurship allow intrapreneurs to think about things from other people's points of view (cognitive and/or emotional empathy) which aids in the design thinking process and customer intimacy. Cognitive flexibility is important for intrapreneurial opportunity recognition, customer intimacy (entrepreneurial empathy), and organisational performance. This flexibility involves the ability (cognitive control) to see that what one is doing isn't working and make appropriate changes (shift) to adapt to new situations, thinking about other options when the original plan is altered with an unexpected change, adapting quickly to changes or new situations, tolerating changes that may occur when problem solving or carrying out a task, creating more alternative solutions. Cognitive control involves the ability to switch ways of thinking, either automatically or deliberately, transitioning from one activity to another, seeing from different points of view and recognising hidden relationships which allow you to more easily find different solutions to the same problem, resisting the impulse to perseverate (keep thinking in a previously active but no longer appropriate manner), and disengage from one task and respond to another, or think about multiple concepts at the same time.

N-Ach often includes intense, prolonged, and repeated efforts to accomplish something difficult. To work with singleness of purpose towards a high and distant goal. To have the determination to win. This need is influenced by your internal drive for action (intrinsic motivation), and the pressure exerted by the expectations of others (extrinsic motivation). N-Ach motivates entrepreneurs to succeed in competition with other businesses, and to excel in activities important to them. You are more likely to seek challenges and a high degree of independence. Your most satisfying reward is more likely to be the recognition of your achievements. Take care though, not all high-need-for-achievement is considered positive…a constant, insatiable need to achieve can lead to anxiety and dysfunction, and that instead of happiness or well-being, high- N-Ach professionals seek \"relief in the accomplishment of tasks\" creating a cycle marked by a lack of a real sense of purpose.",

As a growth-oriented entrepreneur you are more likely to accept higher levels of risk in your career and business decisions than family-income oriented entrepreneurs, and you’re likely to take on much higher levels of risk than managers in large organizations. Growth oriented entrepreneurs have a higher risk tolerance than do managers",
      "low": "People tend to operate one of two main types of new ventures, either growth or lifestyle-oriented businesses. While some entrepreneurs focus on growth, some business owners focus on lifestyle/income. As a lifestyle-oriented entrepreneur you are more likely to desire lower levels of risk in your career and business decisions than family-income oriented entrepreneurs, and you’re likely to take on levels of risk similar to managers in large organizations. Scoring lower in growth orientation simply means that you prefer/would prefer a business that you can manage yourself and/or with a few key employees, that provides/would provide a good living, with a reduced risk of failure, and less likelihood of making you financially wealthy. There is no right or wrong in your growth orientation, it is entirely a life choice. There are many factors to happiness in life and no-one can tell you that their happiness should be your happiness. You do you and enjoy the choices you make."

A growth mindset creates a passion for learning rather than a hunger for approval. Its hallmark is the conviction that human qualities like intelligence and creativity, and even relational capacities such as love and friendship, can be cultivated through effort and deliberate practice. Not only are people with this mindset not discouraged by failure, they don’t actually see themselves as failing in those situations — they see themselves as learning, also known as ‘flearning’.",

The more resilient you are the more your ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. You can’t survive as an entrepreneur without resilience because you are likely to experience failure at least once, maybe multiple times; that’s the nature of trying something that’s never been done before. Resilience means not giving up and being energised by what you have learned. \"I have not failed. I have just found ten thousand ways that won't work\" …resilient, Thomas Edison was. There are times when challenges seem insurmountable – but you are more likely to succeed with resilience! There are times when challenges are so great that you fail. But you will learn. Both experiences are needed for success. Your higher resilience means that you can more easily and quickly overcome setbacks related to your life and career aspirations. Resilience is important for you because it is a dynamic and evolving process through which you acquire the knowledge, abilities and skills to help you face uncertainty with a positive attitude, with creativity and optimism, relying on your own resources. The higher you score the more likely you are to be more resilient when faced with adverse circumstances and the more able to develop and mobilize resources you don’t typically control…quite the definition of being entrepreneurial. Your resilience enables you to renew yourself over time through innovation and adjustments to diverse and turbulent changes in the environment. You tend to have a higher degree of self-esteem; feel you are in control and not afraid to fail; in the case of adversity you are more likely to ‘rise again’ stronger than before due to learning from a situation, having made and learned from mistakes, and seeing them as an opportunity rather than a failure. Go you!",
